## Autostereogram

It is an optical illusion based on the way human eyes capture images from two different points of view. Those different perspectives are interpreted by the brain as a three-dimensional image

The brain processes and superimposes the images collected by each of the eyes, thus obtaining volumes and distances.

The stereograms hide in their pattern two similar images with slight differences. These are positioned in such a way that, when the brain interprets them, it sees these differences as volumes and depths.

here is an easy example

> :P5 sketch=/docs/sketches/stereogram1.js, width=803, height=554

It is an apparently double image, but with subtle differences between one and the other. When crossing the view, a third image appears in the middle 

Which is the same as the previous ones, but in 3D.

To test these stereograms you must first cross your eyes. When a third image appears in the middle, that is, when the other two images merge, do your best to focus your vision on the new image.
