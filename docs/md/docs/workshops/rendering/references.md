# Conclusions and References

## Conclusions 

* Radiosity is a complex algorithm that creates realistic illuminated scenes.
* The implementation of the Radiosity algorithm is complex and it is implemented in the GPU.
* The Radiosity algorithm is based on how the physic works for light and heat transfer.
* Barycentric coordinates works well for the rasterization of triangles.

## Future Work

* Study how can we implement the Radiosity algorithm using shaders and P5.js.
* Study how can we generalize the concept of barycentric coordinates for other kind of shapes.
