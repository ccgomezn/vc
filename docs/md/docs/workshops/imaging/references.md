# Conclusions and References

## Conclusions 

* Techniques such as image filtering and Kernel methods can extract important features of images and videos.
* Software image processing is not fast enough and efficient.
* The selection of font and density of the characters used in ASCII art is incredibly important because that could affect the size and morphology of the images.
* It is important to select an accurate library of photos to used them in the photomosaics because they can transform the colors of the images and make it unrecognizable.
* P5.js makes easy the implementation of great digital art methods such as photomosaics or ASCII art.

## Future Work

* As a future work, it is necessary to explore in a more profound way how kernels can affect images and videos in order to define which kind of kernels use for different objectives.
* Machine Learning is an important research area now; that's why it will be good to explore how to connect p5.js with deep neural networks in order to process images and videos using this technology.
* ASCII art and photomosaics could be extended and developed in a more significant way in order to create new forms of art and impulse areas of marketing and digital arts.
