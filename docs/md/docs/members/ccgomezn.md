# Cristhian Camilo Gomez Neira

## Bio
Algorithms Engineer at Voice123 and Systems Engineer and Mathematics student at Universidad Nacional de Colombia. I'm a full-stack developer and algorithms engineer, passionate about different tech and science areas; daily, I look forward to train and improve my tech skills. My most significant characteristic is the ease when I'm learning; I can master many advanced topics in a short time with a lot of passion and hard work. I will always be more than happy to have significant tech challenges and to think and work on new creative ideas that can push technological developmentâ€”the bigger the tech challenges, the more my commitment and passion.

## Interests
My professional interests are based on areas of mathematical logic and research in data science and artificial intelligence. Every day I tried to research logics related to the computational world or how to mix areas of artificial intelligence and data science with specific logics or model theory. 

## Contributions

I have an article in development based on applying mathematical methods to agriculture measurements, and I'm starting a blog around machine learning, mathematics, and machine learning topics.

## Hobbies

When I have free time, I try to read as much as I can, practice clarinet or saxophone, improve my Russian and German abilities, and play video games.
